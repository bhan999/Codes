1.Tic Tac Toe game code in C language.
    Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking spaces with either an "X" or an "O"
    in an attempt to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game, and if
    the grid fills up without a winner, the game is a draw.

2.Number Shifting game code in C language.
    In the number shifting game, players slide numbered tiles within a grid, aiming to merge identical numbers and reach a specific target,
    often 2048, by strategically moving tiles in four directions (up, down, left, or right) with each turn. The game is won when the target
    number is achieved, and the game ends if no more valid moves can be made.

These we very first projects that I had built to practice. That means there is a lot of improvement in the code, which I know. Let's see if
the readers also are able to suggest.

Thanks!
Cheers!
